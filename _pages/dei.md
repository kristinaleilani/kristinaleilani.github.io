title: Diversity, equity, and inclusion
subtitle: My personal experiences as a racial and gender minority in STEM ground my empathy toward other historically-marginalized scientists. I am committed to combating inequality and prejudice in STEM and supporting underrepresented minorities through mentoring, networking, and activism.

## International Coral Reef Society (ICRS) 

In 2020, I co-founded the equity, diversity, and inclusion committee of the [Student and Early Career Chapter](https://coralreefsecc.org/) of [ICRS](http://coralreefs.org/) with other graduate students researching coral across the globe. We developed original [purpose and philosophy  statements](https://coralreefsecc.org/edi-spd) that constitute our chapterâ€™s stance on DEI issues. We are currently developing workshops and informative materials for disseminating opportunities and resources to increase participation and recognition of underrepresented minorities in coral science.

<p>&nbsp;</p>

Our primary issues of concern incude:

  **Parachute science** (or scientific colonialism), where researchers drop down from the wealthy Western world and exploit foreign communities for fieldwork

  **Institutional Biases** including racism, sexism, etc. in major decisions such as hiring and funding

  **Leaky pipelines,** or the progressive underrepresentation of minorities in STEM

  **Living wages** to combat insufficient incomes for interns, students, and early career scientists

<p>&nbsp;</p>

If you are interested in contributing to our growing knowledgebase of resources, we'd love to work with you. Please email the chapter at icrs.students@gmail.com. 

<sub>*Note: As of 2024, I stepped down as committee lead to focus on similar efforts in Arctic research that align with my current postdoctoral position.*<sub>

## Minorities in Biological Research (MBR)

In 2020, I supported one of my undergraduate mentees in founding [MBR](https://minoritiesinbiologicalresearch.weebly.com/) at UT-Austin. This student-led organization provides guidance to undergraduates that are underrepresented in STEM  and/or first-generation to pursue a career in STEM. We also share resources, disseminate advice, develop and host workshops to help undergraduates prepare for a biological research career. Workshops we've hosted include: 

Getting involved in research at UT-Austin (2022)

Research careers in biology (2021)

Applying for grad school (2020)

### DEI Committees

Since 2022, I joined the DEI committee for the [Department of Integrative Biology](https://integrativebio.utexas.edu/academics/diversity-inclusion) at UT-Austin. We are in the process of reforming the graduate school admissions process to be more inclusive of diverse applicant experiences. We strive to remove barriers such as standardized tests,[^1] which are inherently biased against women, ethnic minorities, and applicants from low-income backgrounds.[^2] Instead, we aim to develop a holistic evidence-based approach to recruit and admit a more diverse student body that accurately reflects the diversity within society.

In 2023 I also joined the DEI committee for the [College of Natural Sciences](https://cns.utexas.edu/) at UT-Austin, and I look forward to expanding DEI work across the broader college.

<sub>*Note: In compliance with current political actions, these committees no longer exist.*<sub>

### Minorities in Shark Sciences (MISS)

Since 2020, I've been part of the [MISS community](https://www.misselasmo.org/) which strives to promote DEI in shark science, and support a network for gender minorities of color to share resources, advice, and opportunities between scientists of all levels. As a member, I've given talks to the community about my experiences as a scientist and mental health in graduate school.

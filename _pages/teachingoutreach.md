title: Teaching, mentoring, and outreach
subtitle: Throughout every component of my research, I make a point to enhance the learning and outreach environment, especially with my undergraduate mentees. I aim to fully support them throughout the research process into publication, and to encourage and facilitate their pursuit of original research questions. I am devoted to becoming the mentor that I needed as a first-generation scientist.

## Teaching

<p>&nbsp;</p>

**Genetics Lab** <br />

TA for 4 semesters of upper-division undergraduate course at the University of Texas at Austin.

I teach laboratory procedures such as:

* _Drosophila_ crosses
* DNA and protein extraction
* Bacterial transformation
* Gel electrophoresis
* PCR
* Western Blot
* DNA barcoding
* Fragment analysis

<p>&nbsp;</p>

**Evolution** <br />
	
TA for one semester of upper-division lecture/discussion course at the University of Texas at Austin.

I led discussions on:

* Natural selection
* Population genetics
* Sexual selection
* Local adaptation
* Phylogenetics and speciation
* Neutral theory of molecular evolution

## Mentoring

<p>&nbsp;</p>

**Research mentor**

* Currently mentoring six undergraduate students in a collaborative research project on coral adaptation. I train my students in all research skills- including genetics lab procedures, bioinformatics pipelines, population genetics analyses in R, and scientific writing- with the intent that all students will be co-authors of the resulting manuscript.

* Mentored two undergraduate interns from the University of the Virgin Islands from May-July 2021 at The Nature Conservancy in St. Croix, USVI. Each intern conducted an individual summer research project on coral restoration. Projects encompassed the full research experience- from experimental design to statistical analysis- and resulted in a final paper and presentation.

<p>&nbsp;</p>

**Laboratory mentor**

* Trained 3 undergraduates in genetics lab procedures (including DNA extraction, PCR, gel electrophoresis, and 2bRAD library prep) at the University of Texas-Austin in 2019. One student went on to complete her own first-author research project and is now pursuing a PhD. 

<p>&nbsp;</p>

**Field mentor**

* 2017: Predator surveys in Isle Royale National Park; one mentee
* 2015-16: Small mammal trapping with anesthesia at the University of Wisconsin-Madison; two mentees

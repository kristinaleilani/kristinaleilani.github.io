## Teaching

**Genetics Lab** <br />

TA for 4 semesters of upper-division undergraduate course at the University of Texas at Austin.

I teach laboratory procedures such as:

* _Drosophila_ crosses
* DNA and protein extraction
* Bacterial transformation
* Gel electrophoresis
* PCR
* Western Blot
* DNA barcoding
* Fragment analysis

<p>&nbsp;</p>

**Evolution** <br />
	
TA for one semester of this upper-division lecture/discussion course at the University of Texas at Austin.

I led discussions on

* Natural selection
* Population genetics
* Sexual selection
* Local adaptation

## Mentoring

Blurb about why I love mentoring

<p>&nbsp;</p>

**Research mentor**


-Currently mentoring six undergraduates on a collaborative research project on coral adaptation. I am training students in all research skills- including genetics lab procedures, sequencing pipelines, population genetics analyses in R, and scientific writing. All students will be co-authors the resulting manuscript.


-Mentored two undergraduate interns from the University of the Virgin Islands from May-August 2021 at The Nature Conservancy in St. Croix, USVI. Each intern project conducted an individual summer research projects on coral restoration from experimental design to statistical analysis, and resulted in a final paper and presentation.

<p>&nbsp;</p>

**Laboratory mentor**

-Trained 3 undergraduates in genetics lab procedures (including DNA extraction, PCR, gel electrophoresis, and 2bRAD library prep) at the University of Texas-Austin in 2019. One student went on to complete her own first-author research project and is now pursuing a PhD. 

<p>&nbsp;</p>

**Field mentor**

* 2017: Predator surveys in Isle Royale National Park; one mentee
* 2015-16: Small mammal trapping with anesthesia at the University of Wisconsin-Madison; two mentees

## Rising Voices, Changing Coasts

I am currently a post-doctoral fellow at the N.S.F. National Center for Atmospheric Research ([NCAR](https://ncar.ucar.edu/)) in Boulder, Colorado working on the Rising Voices, Changing Coasts ([RVCC](https://www.rvcchub.org/)) project. Within this project, I work with the Alaska hub to co-produce climate-focused research questions with tribal partners. These collaborations aim to combine climate model outputs (from the community earth system model [CESM](https://www.cesm.ucar.edu/)) with local observations, Traditional Ecological Knowledge (TEK), and Indigenous Knowledge (IK) to better understand local climate-driven processes and predict ecosystem responses to future climate scenarios. My current project focuses on genetic adaptation to climate change in Chinook salmon across Alaska. Stay tuned for updates!

### Cryptic genetic divergence in the Florida Keys

As coral reefs in the Florida Keys rapidly decline, reef restoration efforts face the challenge of matching outplanted corals to the environment where they are most likely to survive. Using 2bRAD sequencing, we developed a large genomic dataset for two ubiquitous coral species- _Porites astreoides_ and _Agaricia agaricites_ - across 65 reef sites covering the whole Florida reef tract.

We're finding that both species are composed of cryptic lineages across the Florida reef tract. Cryptic genetic diversity is optimistic for facilitating environmental adaptation on a declining reef. Nonetheless, cryptic lineages must be protected in order to maximize adaptive potential and support phenotypic resilience.

### Adaptive divergence by depth

Interestingly, the cryptic lineages often occur sympatrically but have markedly different depth distributions. We're finding that depth plays definitive roles in driving
genetic divergence in both species, although the signatures of selection are much stronger in _A. agaricites_ than _P. astreoides_.

### Adaptation to water quality gradients within cryptic lineages

Surprisingly, the cryptic lineages within each species also appear to adapt to local environments on their own. In _A. agaricites_, nitrogen and cold temperatures appear to drive divergence within lineages. While in _P. astreoides_, temperature extremes appear to be important drivers.

### Seascape genomics in St. Croix, USVI

I am now teaching genotype-environment association analyses using a new dataset of six coral species from St. Croix, USVI. Under my supervision, this project is being led by six undergraduates at UT-Austin, each conducting an independent analysis of their own species of coral. This project provides an opportunity for students to be fully involved in research with an opportunity for co-authorship in the end. This work is funded by [The Nature Conservancy](https://www.nature.org/en-us/about-us/where-we-work/caribbean/virgin-islands/).

## Broader impacts

Local adaptation can determine the stress response and fitness of coral outplants. Therefore, environmental gradients driving genetic divergence can impose strong selective pressure on outplanted corals. Defining environmental barriers is the first step to matching outplanted corals to the sites where they’re most likely to survive.

## Cryptic genetic divergence in the Florida Keys

As coral reefs in the Florida Keys rapidly decline, reef restoration efforts face the challenge of matching outplanted corals to the environment where they are most likely to survive. Using 2bRAD sequencing, we developed a large genomic dataset for two ubiquitous coral species- _Porites astreoides_ and _Agaricia agaricites_ - across 65 reef sites covering the whole Florida reef tract.

We observed that both species are composed of three cryptic lineages across the Florida reef tract. Cryptic genetic diversity that is optimistic for facilitating environmental adaptation on a declining reef. Nonetheless, cryptic lineages must be protected in order to maximize adaptive potential and support phenotypic resilience.

### Adaptive divergence by depth

Here's a really neat custom feature we added â€“ galleries:

<div class="gallery" data-columns="3">
	<img src="/images/demo/demo-portrait.jpg">
	<img src="/images/demo/demo-landscape.jpg">
	<img src="/images/demo/demo-square.jpg">
	<img src="/images/demo/demo-landscape-2.jpg">
</div>

Inspired by the Galleries feature from WordPress, we've made it easy to create grid layouts for your images. Just use a bit of simple HTML in your post to create a masonry grid image layout:


*See what we did there? Code and syntax highlighting is built-in too!*

Change the number inside the 'columns' setting to create different types of gallery for all kinds of purposes. You can even click on each image to seamlessly enlarge it on the page.

### Adaptation to water quality gradients within cryptic lineages

Here's another gallery with only one column, which creates a carousel slide-show instead.

A nice little feature: the carousel only advances when it is in view, so your visitors won't scroll down to find it half way through your images.

<div class="gallery" data-columns="1">
	<img src="/images/demo/demo-landscape.jpg">
	<img src="/images/demo/demo-landscape-2.jpg">
</div>

## Epigenetic clock

Most vertebrates have an &quot;epigenetic clock&quot; where the rate of DNAm on the genome increases with age. Therefore, it should be possible to estimate the age of an individual from which the eDNA came based on its methylation profile.

First the clock will be calibrated using DNA from fin clips from sharks of known age, ranging from neonates to adults. Their methylation profiles will be built into a model for predicting the age of new shark samples from their methylation profiles.

## Mapping age structure with eDNA

Once the trained predictive model can reliably classify new samples into neonates, juveniles, subadults, and adults, this method will be taken to the field. A proof of concept will be conducted in a known nursery site when the concentration of neonates should be high inside the nursery while the concentration of adults should be high outside.

eDNA will be sampled inside and outside the nursery, and the resulting methylation profiles will be tested by the model to determine the age of sharks in the two areas. eDNA should reveal a wide age range of sharks, including neonates, occurring in the nursery, while adult sharks only should be detected outside the nursery.

## Broader impacts

These results will be useful for shark conservation, as identifying and protecting nursery habitat is highly important for protecting endangered sharks. Once proven in a known nursery, this method will be applicable to find and verify probable nurseries for other species.

## Epigenetic clock and mapping age structure with eDNA

Most vertebrates have an &quot;epigenetic clock&quot; where the rate of DNA methylation (DNAm) on the genome increases with age. Therefore, using a model to classify shark methylation profiles into age groups (neonates, juveniles, subadults, or adults), it should be possible to estimate the age of sharks in an area from which environmental DNA (eDNA) is sampled.

## Broader impacts

These results will be useful for shark conservation, as identifying and protecting nursery habitat is highly important for protecting endangered sharks. Once proven in a known nursery, this method will be applicable to find and verify probable nurseries for other species.

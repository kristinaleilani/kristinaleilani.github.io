## Finding adaptive genetic variants to improve fitness of coral outplants

Sexual propogation is an opportunity to enhance the adaptive potential of restored populations. During the annual coral spawning event, we conduct reciprocal crosses to produce new genetic variation and explore heritability of environmental adaptations. By evaluating fitness of coral larvae, recruits, and adult colonies in common gardens and transplant experiments in the field, I aim to identify parental genotypes containing heritable environmental adaptations for producing a new generation of corals with the best chances of survival.

(Middle) Multiple substrates on a rod, each containing multiple coral recruits, outplanted to the reef to undergo selection in the field. (Right) A coral recruit surviving on an overgrown substrate, retrieved after one year in the field. Survivors such as these provide genetic insights to adaptations that can improve fitness of coral outplants._

### Finding genes for thermal regulation

Thermally induced coral bleaching is a major cause of reef decline in the Great Barrier Reef of Australia. However, the diversity of reef environments could be a source of thermally adaptive genetic variants. I am exploring genes under selection across a latitudinal gradient in the Great Barrier Reef to identify genes that may be important for thermal regulation in corals. I am also evaluating the importance of putatively adaptive genes through changes in gene expression from a reciprocal transplant experiment across latitudes.

### Broader impacts

These projects support reef restoration by identifying adaptive genotypes for increasing fitness of coral outplants. Using adaptive variants in sexual propogation of corals (aka "assisted gene flow") can facilitate evolution to global change. The direct outcomes of these projects will support restoration efforts through: 1) defining environmental barriers to gene flow for guiding spatial arrangement of outplanted corals, and 2) choosing optimal parental colonies for coral breeding.

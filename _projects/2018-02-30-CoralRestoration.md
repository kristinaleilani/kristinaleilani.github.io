## Parental effects to improve outplant fitness

Quick synopsis

Through a combination of common garden experiments and transplant experiments in the field, ...

_Pictured above: (Left) Newly settled coral recruits on artificial substrate. (Middle) Multiple substrates, each containing multiple coral recruits, strung on a rod and outplanted to the reef to undergo selection in the field. (Right) A coral recruit surviving on an overgrown substrate, retrieved from the selection experiment after one year in the field. Survivors such as these provide genetic insights to adaptations that are important for the longevity of coral outplants._

You can create lists:

* Simple bulleted lists
* Like this one
* Are cool

And:

1. Numbered lists
2. Like this other one
3. Are great too



And footnotes[^1], which link to explanations[^2] at the bottom of the page[^3].

*See what we did there? Code and syntax highlighting is built-in too!*

Change the number inside the 'columns' setting to create different types of gallery for all kinds of purposes. You can even click on each image to seamlessly enlarge it on the page.

## International Coral Reef Society (ICRS) 

In 2020, I co-founded the equity, diversity, and inclusion committee of the [Student and Early Career Chapter](https://www.coralreefstudents.org/) of ICRS with other graduate students researching coral across the globe. We developed original [purpose and philosophy  statements](https://www.coralreefstudents.org/edi) that constitute our chapter’s stance on DEI issues. We are currently developing workshops and informative materials to disseminate opportunities and resources to increase participation and recognition of underrepresented minorities in coral science.

Our primary issues of concern incude:

* **Parachute science** (or scientific colonialism), where researchers drop down from the wealthy Western world and exploit foreign communities for fieldwork

* **Institutional Biases** including racism, sexism, etc. in major decisions such as hiring and funding

* **Leaky pipelines,** or the progressive underrepresentation of minorities in STEM

* **Living wages** to combat insufficient incomes for interns, students, and early career scientists

If you are interested in contributing to our growing knowledgebase of resources, we'd love to work with you. Please email me or the chapter at icrs.students@gmail.com

### Integrative Biology DEI Committee

Since 2022, I joined the DEI committee for the [Department of Integrative Biology](https://integrativebio.utexas.edu/academics/diversity-inclusion) at UT-Austin. We are in the process of reforming the graduate school admissions process to be more inclusive of diverse applicant experiences. We strive to remove barriers like as standardized tests,[^1] which are inherently biased against women, ethnic minorities, and applicants from low-income backgrounds.[^2] Instead, we aim to develop a holistic evidence-based approach to recruit and admit a more diverse student body that accurately reflects the diversity within society.

### Minorities in Shark Sciences (MISS)

Since 2020, I've been part of the [MISS community](https://www.misselasmo.org/) which strives to promote DEI in shark science, and support a network for gender minorities of color to share resources, advice, and opportunities between scientists of all levels.
